BULLMASTIFF -  BASE PHASE
The  Base  intermediate  program  uses  all  4  big  movements  follows  
them up with a developmental variation for the opposite movement 
and then general bodybuilding work . At this point, the variations and 
the  smaller  bodybuilding  movements  should  aim  to  make  lagging  
areas a priority; don’t dedicate time to your third pectoral isolation 
exercise if that’s not the limiting factor in your bench .

Bullmastiff operates off of a 3 week wave structure, meaning stress 
increases  each  session  over  a  3  week  period  before  dropping  back  
and building back up . Remember the ‘dirt road’ analogy . The last set 
of the main exercise is performed for an AMRAP and that number 
is used to estimate a weight jump for the following week . This is a 
method of auto-regulation made famous by Doug Young .
To determine your weight jumps each week, add 1% of your 1 rep 
max for every extra rep you did on the AMRAP . If you are working 
through sets of 6 and performed 10 on the AMRAP, that is 4 extra 
reps  so  your  weight  jump  would  be  4%  of  your  1  rep  max .  If  I’m  
operating  off  of  a  1  rep  max  of  400lbs,  that’s  16lbs  (we  can  safely  
round down to 15) . 
Using this auto-regulation tactic, here’s how that might play out in 
real life with a 400lb squatter .

**** Note that the AMRAP on the third week doesn’t dictate the weight in 
week 4; it defaults back to the percentage established above.
Compared to the novice program, the progression change here hits 
on multiple fronts:
Going from step-loading, which is entirely sub-maximal and volume 
based,  to  a  program  that  features  an  all-out  set  at  the  end  of  each  
workout represents a major shift in the type of stress . This is a kick in 
the pants to diminished returns, which prevents the same method of 
progression from working forever . You will be sensitive to the failure 
sets and you will grow like you were new all-over again . Think of it 
like a type of re-virgination . 
The weights now increase week to week, making intensity a driving 
force of progress . This is a new stimulus as well but also one that is 
more strength-specific than the step loading . You’ve done the work 
to build a base, now we can start to reap the benefits of specialization . 
The  training  program  now  has  a  deadline,  meaning  you  aren’t  
just  running  it  until  the  wheels  fall  off .  This  is  your  introduction  
to periodization, where you get to experience how changes in load 
and volume effect your training week to week and how those weeks 
combine  into  blocks  of  training .  Pay  attention  to  how  your  body

responds and take notes; these are the things you will need to know 
about yourself down the road .

Selecting  weights  for  secondary  movements  requires  some  extra  
thought .  The  main  movement  gets  more  demanding  as  time  goes  
on,  which  means  you  will  be  more  fatigued  each  week  going  into  
your  variation  movements .  This  makes  it  more  difficult  to  use  
linear weight jumps for the secondary movements as the means of 
progressive overload . You can bank on adding a certain amount of 
weight  to  your  bench  each  week,  but  then  adding  weight  to  your  
close grip, then your dumbbell presses, then your isolation work . . . . . 
you will find this approach to progressive overload akin to ice skating 
uphill .
An  easy  way  to  get  around  that  is  to  not  worry  about  jacking  the  
weight up on variation movements week to week . Instead, you can 
focus on how much total work you do in a workout (what I refer to 
as ‘volumizing’) which is done by adding a set each week to the same 
weight and rep scheme . Many don’t like using volume as a tool for 
progression because, well, it’s hard damn work, (save your ‘reps over 
5 is cardio’ memes for you Class 4 Powerlifting buddies) . 
Sure,  a  lot  of  sets  across  can  make  your  eyes  glaze  over  at  times,  
but  I  find  it  to  be  way  more  sustainable  than  trying  to  maintain  

 158 
AlEx BRomlEy
the aggression required to pull out weight jumps across every single 
exercise  week  to  week .  Many  of  you  newbies  might  be  under  the  
impression that going Super Saiyan 5 on every set  is the key to long 
term growth but that just isn’t a thing . 
As stress continues to increase over an entire phase, you will be tired . 
You will get disillusioned . You will have fluctuations in neurological 
and hormonal activity that sidelines the aggression you typically rely 
on for big attempts .
And  yet  you  will  still  be  responsible  for  doing  something  that  
improves upon last week’s efforts . 
Don’t  fall  into  the  ‘punish  and  pray’  trap  where  your  workout  plan  
hinges on a prayer that your weekly increases in strength will be enough 
to keep adding weight onto the bar indefinitely . Save your aggression 
for the main lift and use the secondary movements as homework .
Rules for volumizing are as follows:
• Start with a weight that puts you around a 6/10 effort for 
ALL sets and reps, that’s something that easily leaves 4 reps 
in the tank . If fatigue from set to set causes that to go to a 7 
or 8/10, don’t be a hero: drop the weight accordingly or you 
won’t last through the program . The percentages I provide 
are a good starting point, but it’s ok if you don’t have a max 
to go off of and want to pick your weights based on feel . 
You’ll have to learn to accurately estimate your abilities set 
to set eventually, so might as well start now .
• Add one working set the following week and keep the same 
reps . That might seem like an underwhelming method of 
progression,  but  the  point  here  is  to  schedule  something  
sustainable  that  you  can  follow  for  weeks  on  end .  Be  
concerned  about  the  strain  you  will  be  experiencing  in  
week 7, not week 2 .

 159 
PEAK STRENGTH
• Weight  increases  are  allowed  but  ONLY  if  it  keeps  you  
at  the  prescribed  difficulty .  A  grindy  or  missed  rep  from  
an  overeager  attempt  will  require  dropping  the  weight  
back  at  some  point  or  else  you  will  have  no  options  for  
moving forward that don’t outright abandon this pattern 
of progression . The sooner you advance weight, the sooner 
you will have to reset . We aren’t here to wing it, we want to 
keep things moving forward on schedule, so silence your 
ego and be objective .
Here’s an example for our 400lb squatter . He hasn’t front squatted in 
some time, so he bases his numbers off of a conservative 315lb max . 
Not being used to sets of 12, especially with this exercise, he starts 
even more conservatively at 50% and resolves to tweak the numbers 
as needed based on the difficulty of each set .

Week  1  sucked .  The  first  set  moved  extremely  fast  and  with  little  
effort,  but  each  set  was  exponentially  harder  than  the  one  before .  
12s were a different ball game . The last set featured burning quads, 
cramping  abdominals  and  crippling  fatigue  in  the  mid-back .  That  
was  nothing  when  compared  to  the  sharp  pain  in  the  lungs  that  
worsened with each breath and lingered long after the set was over; 
think of suicide drills in the snow . Thank goodness for conservative 
weight selection .
After  finishing  the  squats  in  week  2,  the  thought  of  repeating  last  
weeks effort made for sweaty palms and nervous pacing . After a 10 
minute argument with himself to skip the squat variant altogether, 
our squatter resolved to get it done . “You don’t have to break yourself, 

 160 
AlEx BRomlEy
just  get  the  work  done” .  Shockingly  enough,  each  set  flew  with  
minimal fatigue . He could not believe how quickly he had adapted .
Week  3,  he  kicked  around  the  idea  of  making  a  weight  jump,  but  
decided against it . Week 4 would feature a lower rep range, which 
seemed  to  be  a  better  opportunity  to  increase  load .  “Just  get  the  
volume in and be done with 12s forever!” The 5x12 went easier than 
3x12 week 1 and this led to a bump in confidence and excitement for 
the waves to follow . On to something big for next week!

The amraps on the main squat set were starting to get much more 
draining .  Instead  of  making  an  overeager  jump  and  hitting  the  
brick  wall  in  the  front  squats  early,  our  squatter  resolved  to  stay  
conservative .  The  10s  at  175lbs  went  smooth  weeks  4  and  5  and  
represented more weight and total work in this exercise than he had 
done in quite a long time . 
Knowing  that  the  volume  would  drop  substantially  in  week  7,  he  
thought,  “what  the  hell,  I’ll  work  a  little  harder  this  week” .  He  
bumped week 6 to 185lb and ran through all 5 sets without incident .

This  was  the  last  wave  of  the  Base  Phase,  meaning  that  a  period  
of recovery was on the horizon . This is where we leave it all on the 
table . Week 7 was a nice recovery period from the week before which 

 161 
PEAK STRENGTH
allowed a small weight bump into week 8 . The difficulty still never 
climbed  over  8/10 .  It  was  decided  that  the  last  week  of  the  entire  
phase would be a barn burner, so he went for it, piling on 225 and 
committing to finishing all 5 sets of 8 . The last set went up with 2-3 
left in the tank and he grinned, remembering that he couldn’t hit a 
single set of 8 at the start of the phase, let alone 5 easy sets of it .
BASE BODYBUILDING ACCESSORY 
PROGRESSION
The progression of other accessories (machines, dumbbells, unilateral 
work, isolation, etc .) is much the same as with the variation of the 
main  barbell  lift .  We  are  going  to  volumize,  again  adding  a  set  to  
each workout over the course of a way . 
We don’t have to worry too much about walking the line of fatigue 
with these movements since they come later in the workout . Pushing 
the last few sets of leg extensions or tricep pushdowns can create a 
huge push for new growth and doesn’t lead to the type of systemic 
fatigue  that  might  hinder  performance  the  following  week .  But  
remember, we are prioritizing volume as the yardstick for measuring 
progressive  overload  and  that’s  accomplished  most  easily  when  
weight and reps stay similar week to week .

I  generally  start  the  compound  and  isolation  accessory  at  2  sets,  
building  up  to  3  and  4  over  the  first  wave .  This  is  a  personal  
preference,  since  the  shock  of  the  repeating  high  rep  sets  on  the  
main movement and variation often wipe me out early on . Your goal 
is to steadily adapt to the demands of the training over many weeks, 
not to begin a phase by biting off more than you can chew .
When the reps drop a bit in waves 2 and 3 and I’m more conditioned 
to the work, I’ll reset the wave with 3 sets on the accessory and build 
up  to  5,  sometimes  even  higher  on  smaller  isolation  movements .  
Remember  that  it’s  the  increases  in  work  relative  to  what  you  are  
used  to  that  forces  new  growth,  not  the  adherence  to  an  arbitrary  
number of sets and reps .

This might be a lot more work than you are used to . That’s a good 
thing;  more  work  is  necessary  to  continue  past  the  intermediate  
stage .  At  the  most,  we  are  talking  about  6  working  sets  on  the  
main  movement,  5  on  the  variation  and  4-6  on  a  handful  of  
smaller  movements  (though  most  weeks  have  much  less) .  This  is  
not an exceptional amount of work for a competitive lifter and it’s 
a  very  small  amount  of  work  for  most  bodybuilders  and  physique  
competitors . 
If your percentages are on point and you are honest with how you 
evaluate RPE, the only reason you couldn’t recover from this is if you 

 163 
PEAK STRENGTH
are starved for food or sleep . There are programs that will attempt to 
work around those circumstances, but this isn’t one of them .
If you do take your role as a competitor seriously and mold yourself 
to this structure, the end result will be a base so wide you can park 
an air craft carrier on it .

Reps  are  lower  here  and  percentages  will  be  consistently  closer  to  
90% . The auto-regulation method still determines our weight jumps 
going into every 2nd and 3rd week but resetting back to the reduced 
percentages at the beginning of each wave is important to keep this 
sustainable .
More developed intermediates might find that handling the heavy 
percentages  with  4  movements  each  week  presents  a  challenge .  
A  technique  that  flirts  with  ‘advanced’  territory  is  to  move  the  4  
workouts  beyond  a  7  day  week .  This  is  the  default  move  in  the  
advanced  template  that  comes  after  this  one .  Below  is  a  3  day  per  
week example; it can easily be turned into 4 days per week by fixing 
a GPP day to every Saturday .

All of the variation movements will have to intensify along with the 
main  lifts .  You  won’t  have  an  established  one  rep  max  for  most  of  
them so it’s best to gauge appropriate working weights according to 
RP E . 
ACCESSORY WORK
So  much  effort  will  be  given  to  the  main  lifts  and  their  variations  
that we will only keep in a few vital accessory movements . The upper 
back, triceps, rear delts and rotator cuff are the most important here 
and they can be kept up to standard with one exercise done for 3-5 
sets of 8-12 reps . There isn’t a need to wave the progression in any 
complex manner, just keep the reps in that range and keep the effort

high . You can use the advanced fatigue techniques outlined later in 
the book if things start to stagnate .
Wave  3  of  the  Peak  phase  should  only  feature  the  main  lifts  and  
variations; drop all of the accessory movements at this point .
